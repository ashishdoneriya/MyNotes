> [Recording begins.]That is the glory of the International Society for
> Krishna Consciousness. Srila Prabhupada has brought all these wonderful
> devotees, the most exalted personalities of the planet together in this
> International Society for Krishna Consciousness. We are very fortunate that
> we have found this community and somehow we have become connected to this
> community, this society. The devotees are the most exalted people on this
> planet especially the followers of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
> 
> It is so wonderful that so many of you have come from different parts of the
> world - the leaders of Iskcon, to give each other this wonderful opportunity
> of sadhu sanga, association of devotees. Srila Prabhupada wanted this on the
> occasion of Gaura Purnima festival and Navadvip Mandal Parikrama - Srila
> Prabhupada wanted the devotees to come from all over the world and enrich
> themselves with the association. Thank you all very much for coming here. I
> first of all like to thank Gopal Bhatta Prabhu for organising this wonderful
> festival. It was due to his initiative and the hard work of his team - The
> Strategic Planning Team - that this festival has become a reality.
> 
> The other day we were discussing about it and one devotee commented that two
> and a half years ago this was inconceivable - to get all the devotees, all
> the leaders of Iskcon to come and get together. So he commented that two and
> a half years ago this concept was inconceivable. It was an impossibility.
> And another devotee commented what to speak of two and a half years even two
> and a half months back it was an inconceivable concept, but it happened. In
> on hand the sincere effort of the Strategic Planning Team under the
> leadership of Gopal Bhatta Prabhu and at the same time the sincere devotees
> of Mayapur who made it happen. They made all the wonderful arrangements
> here. I hope all of you are comfortably situated here. [Haribol] Thank you.
> All glories to Srila Prabhupada.
> As you have been hearing before like yesterday HH Romapada Maharaj also
> mentioned that Mother Laxmimoni actually left it up to us to select the
> verses. Only for HH Radhanath Maharaj she selected the verses because HH
> Radhanath Maharaj left it up to her. So I selected this verse. I will
> explain to you later on why.
> 
> matr-bhaktih para-strisu
> patnyam ardha ivatmanah
> prajasu pitrvat snigdhah
> kinkaro brahma-vadinam
> 
> TRANSLATION: The King will respect all women as if they were his own mother,
> and he will treat his own wife as the other half of his body. He will be
> just like an affectionate father to his citizens, and he will treat himself
> as the most obedient servant of the devotees, who always preach the glories
> of the Lord.
> 
> PURPORT: A learned man treats all women except his wife as his mother, looks
> on others' property as garbage in the street, and treats others as he would
> treat his own self. These are the symptoms of a learned person as described
> by Canakya Pandita. This should be the standard for education. Education
> does not mean having academic degrees only. One should execute what he has
> learned in his personal life. These learned characteristics were verily
> manifest in the life of King Prthu. Although he was the king, he treated
> himself as a servant of the Lord's devotees. According to Vedic etiquette,
> if a devotee came to a king's palace, the king would immediately offer his
> own seat to him. The word brahma-vadinam is very significant. Brahma-vadi
> refers to the devotees of the Lord. Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan are
> different terms for the Supreme Brahman, and the Supreme Brahman is Lord
> Krsna. This is accepted in Bhagavad-gita (10.12) by Arjuna (param brahma
> param dhama). Thus the word brahma-vadinam refers to the devotees of the
> Lord. The state should always serve the devotees of the Lord, and the ideal
> state should conduct itself according to the instructions of the devotee.
> Because King Prthu followed this principle, he is highly praised. [End of
> Srila Prabhupada's purport to SB 4.16.17]
> 
> HH Bhakti Charu Swami: So the sutas, the professional reciters are singing
> the glory of Prthu Maharaj. The last chapter ended when Prthu Maharaja told
> them that, "All that you are saying that I have been endowed with, all the
> qualities, all the attributes, I haven't manifested them. Why are you saying
> things like that because people will think it is just flattery?" Then this
> chapter begins with the Sutas who are actually exalted brahmanas although
> their business is to recite the glory of different exalted personalities
> especially the kings. But they are individuals who are actually situated in
> the Absolute Truth. They are situated in the transcendental platform. They
> declared, "You are the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
> You have come down here to bless all of us and set the standard of ideal
> leadership."
> 
> While describing the glory of Prthu Maharaja in this way they came to this
> point. These four points: respect for women, for householder, treating his
> wife as the other half, treating the citizens as his own children and
> respect for the brahmanas and Vaisnavas - devotees of the Lord - these are
> the very foundation of Vedic culture.
> 
> Vedic culture has been established, has been given by Krishna Himself. It is
> not any culture of any particular place as such. It is the spiritual culture
> to uplift the spirit soul to the spiritual platform freeing himself from the
> bondage of matter. In the material nature everyone is bound. Material nature
> is a prison house and the shackles with which the living entities are bound
> in this material nature is sex desire. Therefore this material nature is
> described as maithunya-agara or prison house of sex desire. The Vedic
> culture actually teaches on how to transcend, how to free oneself from that
> entanglement, how to free oneself from this shackles that is binding him
> into this material nature.
> 
> As I was explaining earlier why I selected this verse. It is because I felt
> this verse is giving a very, very clear understanding of how the leaders
> should conduct themselves and how the leaders must train their followers.
> The first principle is respect for women. It is the respect for women that
> builds ones character. The Bengali expression for a debauchee is
> characterless, caritahi. Carita means character and hina means devoid of. So
> one who is a debauchee doesn't have any character.
> 
> In order to develop ones noble character - in order to develop nobility in
> one's self one must learn, one must be trained to respect women. How? Like a
> mother. Actually all of us are most indebted to our mother. It is because of
> her we are here. She underwent so many difficulties, so many trials and
> tribulations, so much suffering just to bring us into this planet. And it is
> due to her care that we actually grew up, we developed this body and the
> body grew. That is why the respect for mother naturally grows and she is the
> ideal woman.
> 
> So matr-bhaktih para-strisu. This kind of respect one should have towards
> all the women. Then when he gets married he should treat his wife not as an
> object of sense gratification. What to speak of other women - he doesn't
> even treat his dually married wife also as an object of sense gratification.
> He treats his wife as his other half of his self, part of his self. That is
> another consideration that is another concept.
> 
> A man, what to speak of considering other women as objects of sense
> gratification, he doesn't even treat his wife as an object of sense
> gratification. He has some responsibilities in this nature. A householder
> therefore gets married - putrarthe kriyate bharya. Why does one get married?
> In order to produce or procreate children - putrarthe kriyate bharya. Then
> he is saha dharmin - he conducts the same religion. He cannot perform
> religious activities himself alone. Therefore he needs his wife to be with
> him. When Lord Ramacandra banished Sita to the asrama of Valmiki whenever
> Lord Ramacandra would perform a yajna he had to have His wife with Him so a
> golden Sita was built and He conducted the sacrifice with ...Sita next to
> Him. This is the Vedic culture - saha dharmin. In the one hand she is
> ardhangini and saha dharmini - half of his self and he conducts religious
> activities especially the activities that one conducts in the household life
> along with her.
> 
> Then the third consideration is how should he treat his followers? Here they
> are talking about King Prthu. But King Prthu is actually an ideal leader. He
> is a king. Not that the king has the responsibility to treat his citizens as
> his own children but that is the responsibility of an ideal personality, an
> ideal leader. He must take care of them, guide them in their lives, take
> care of them.
> 
> The word praja literally means someone who is specially born - that means he
> is his son but not born of him and his wife - children that are not born of
> him but still they are his children. prakrsta-rupena jayate. So that is how
> a king must treat his citizens. That is how a leader must treat his
> followers.
> 
> Then kinkaro brahma-vadinam - although he is a king, although he is such an
> exalted personality he is an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of
> Godhead but he treats the devotees as his master and he places himself as
> their servant, kinkaro brahma-vadinam. The kings are so humble that they
> treat the devotees as their honourable master. "Please tell me what can I do
> for you?" Prabhupada mentioned this is a very common Vedic practice. Those
> days when an exalted personality came, when a sage or a devotee came to the
> palace of the king the king stood up from his throne and offered the throne
> to that person. We have seen that Krishna did that to Sudama. A brahmana
> came to Him. Krishna the Supreme Personality of Godhead is setting the
> standard. He made Sudama sit on His seat, on His throne and washed his feet.
> Washed his feet! So this is Vedic culture.
> 
> Srila Prabhupada came to establish or rather re-establish the Vedic culture
> in this planet when it is practically lost. We are seeing that the opposite
> things are happening now. Nobody looks up to women as mother. All over there
> is a massive propaganda to look at women as an object of sense
> gratification. Everywhere all they are showing is just women half exposed.
> There is no family life. Even when they get married then the marriage
> doesn't last for very long. They break off. Very few marriages are lasting
> nowadays. To begin with they don't get married. Those who get married get
> divorced soon afterwards. What to speak of treating the subordinates as
> their own children, they don't even take care of their own children. And
> what to speak of having any respect for the exalted devotees of the Lord.
> They don't have any respect for anybody - a culture of disrespect.
> 
> The Vedic culture is established on sraddha, on respect and materialistic
> culture in the age of Kali is founded on disrespect. So this is the
> responsibility that we have as followers of Srila Prabhupada. We have to
> establish the Vedic culture - re-establish the Vedic culture. Why? Because
> this is the most important thing that is happening in this world. This is
> the most wonderful thing that is happening in this world today - revival of
> Krishna consciousness, revival of Vedic culture. Not only the Vedic culture!
> Vedic culture also has various aspects. What Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu gave is
> the most glorious, exalted essence of the Vedic culture. Krsna-bhakti,
> vraja-preme.
> 
> atyanta durlabha prema koribare dana
> sikhaya saranagati bhakatera prana [SNG: Introductory Song]
> 
> Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu came in order to teach the process of devotion in
> order to give this krsna-prema to the living entities in this age of Kali.
> And Caitanya Mahaprabhu with his discussion with Ramananda Raya made it
> clear that this is the essence of the spiritual gifts. The most exalted
> spiritual position is Krishna bhakti.
> 
> In Bhagavad-gita Arjuna asked Krishna and Krishna instructed Arjuna.
> Mahaprabhu's order is in a reverse order. Now Krishna came and He is asking
> Arjuna, just like the teacher sometimes asks the student to find out whether
> he understood the subject, "So Ramananda, what is the ultimate goal of
> life?" And Ramananda Raya speaks about varnasrama dhama.
> 
> varnasramacara-vata
> purusena parah puman
> visnur aradhyate pantha
> nanyat tat-tosa-karanam [Cc Madhya 8.58]
> 
> Performance of varnasrama is the ultimate goal of life and that is the best
> way to please Visnu and worship Visnu. Mahaprabhu rejected that. "No. That
> is external." That is not the highest. That is mundane." Then Ramananda Raya
> spoke about karma-yoga and he is substantiating his statement by scriptural
> evidence.
> 
> yat karosi yad asnasi
> yaj juhosi dadasi yat
> yat tapasyasi kaunteya
> tat kurusva mad-arpanam [CC Madhya 8.60]
> 
> Mahaprabhu rejected that. "eho bahya," [Cc Madhya 8.61] " This is also
> external. Tell Me what is beyond that." Age kaha ara. Then Ramananda Raya
> speaks about karma sannyasa - renunciation of karma.
> 
> sarva-dharman parityajya
> mam ekam saranam vraja
> aham tvam sarva-papebhyo
> moksayisyami ma sucah [Cc Madhya 8.63]
> 
> The final instruction of Krishna in Bhagavad-gita. But Mahaprabhu rejected
> that also. "This is also external. Tell Me what is beyond that." Then he
> speaks about nana-misra bhakti.
> 
> brahma-bhutah prasannatma
> na socati na kanksati
> samah sarvesu bhutesu
> mad-bhaktim labhate param [Cc Madhya 8.65]
> 
> But Mahaprabhu rejected that also. "No. It is external. Tell Me what is
> beyond that." Although it says param - mad-bhaktim labhate param, in this
> platform one receives My transcendental devotion. But He rejects that. Then
> Ramananda Raya speaks about suddha bhakti.
> 
> anyabhilasita-sunyam jnana-karmady-anavrtam
> anukulyena krsnanu-silanam bhaktir uttama [ [Cc. Madhya 19.167]
> 
> Uttama bhakti, pure devotion. Mahaprabhu accepted that. "Yes. That is right.
> Now tell Me what is beyond that." Gradually Ramananda Raya speaks about
> bhakti in santa rasa, bhakti in dasya rasa, bhakti in sakhya rasa, bhakti in
> vatsalya rasa, bhakti in madhurya rasa. Mahaprabhu accepted them one after
> another and then He says, "Tell Me what is beyond that." Then Ramananda Raya
> says, "I did not know if anyone could ask what is beyond that." [Laughter]
> But You are asking me the questions and at the same time You are empowering
> me also to answer. So please if You empower me then I will be able to answer
> Your question."
> 
> Then in this way from madhurya rasa he goes to the very special aspect of
> madhurya rasa. That is Krishna is dancing with thousands of gopis but in the
> center Krishna is dancing alone with one gopi. So that gopi must be very
> special. Then this gopi became upset with Krishna and She left the rasa
> mandali. And Krishna left all the gopis - thousand of gopis, sixty-four
> thousand gopis and He followed Her. So She must be very special. So who is
> this particular gopi? One who is very special in Her aradhana. In this way
> Radharani's identity was revealed.
> 
> Then he pointed out that this Radha and Krishna now became in Their intense
> loving exchange, They became one. Mahaprabhu covered His face. "Okay. You
> don't have to tell anymore." Because now His identity is going to become
> exposed. So this is what Srila Prabhupada came to give to this world. That
> is why he created this Iskcon. With so much effort Srila Prabhupada created
> this most wonderful International Society for Krishna Consciousness.
> 
> What a vision Srila Prabhupada had! Prabhupada knew his mission is to spread
> Krishna consciousness all over the world fulfilling the prediction of Sri
> Caitanya Mahaprabhu. That is why he considered the importance of an
> institution. Because this is a mission that couldn't be possible, that
> wouldn't be possible in one person's lifetime. What to speak of when
> Prabhupada was starting this mission at the age of seventy - how many years
> he had? Prabhupada knew he did not have much time. So Prabhupada knew there
> must be an institution to continue the mission and that is how right from
> the beginning Srila Prabhupada's emphasises was in this institution of
> Iskcon.
> 
> The other day Gopal Bhatta Prabhu just mentioned how when Prabhupada set up
> Iskcon in 26 2nd Avenue, Prabhupada printed a visiting card and that
> visiting card said, A.C Bhaktivedanta Swami, founder acarya of the
> International Society for Krishna Consciousness with centres all over the
> world. [Laughter] Just a small little storefront he is starting and to begin
> with, he names it as the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. As
> you all know there was consideration and doubts about calling it a society
> for Krishna consciousness. They suggested, "No.No. Call it International
> society for God consciousness because people would not understand who
> Krishna is."
> 
> Prabhupada was so emphatic, "i have come here to teach everybody that
> Krishna is God. You speak of God but you don't have any understanding of who
> God is I have come to teach you who God is. And that is Krishna. That is why
> that must be the name for the institution."
> 
> As you also know when Prabhupada was walking in the park in New York less
> than a week after his arrival in New York City. Prabhupada was sitting on a
> bench in the park and one Jewish gentleman came and sat next to Prabhupada
> and out of curiosity he started to ask who he was, where he came from. And
> what did Prabhupada tell him? He came from India and he has temples all over
> the world. And he said, "You just said you came just the other day. How can
> I believe that you have temples all over the world?" He said, "Yes they are
> there. Only time is separating us."
> 
> Prabhupada knew what is going to happen. He is a trikala darsana. He knew
> what would happen. That is why with such conviction he could admit, he could
> say that this is what is going to happen. In order to continue that mission
> Prabhupada saw the need for a spiritual organisation. In order to secure
> that organisation Prabhupada established two concepts very, very clearly:
> His position as the founder acarya and the concept of the collective
> management through the governing body.
> 
> Sometimes some of our devotees who left Iskcon they say things like, Iskcon
> is dead and they are actually creating the real Iskcon. Once I had an
> encounter with one such person who was claiming that they are really
> creating the real Iskcon. I asked them, "What do you mean by real Iskcon?"
> And then we got into a discussion about Iskcon and my point was that Iskcon
> is the institution where Prabhupada is the founder acarya and the GBC is the
> ultimate managing authority. That is the identity of Iskcon. If you can
> create an institution where Prabhupada is the founder acarya and a body of
> collective management of GBC maintaining that institution yes you can claim,
> but you haven't. This Iskcon is going on with that concept and that is why
> with time you will see how this Iskcon will flourish and fulfil the
> prediction of Caitanya Mahaprabhu. [Haribol. Applause]
> 
> Sometimes another question also comes. This question comes from people from
> India, especially the babajis and some individuals of Radha-kund and the
> Vrindavan area. They say that our sampradaya is not bona fide. They say that
> the way Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura drew the line is not a line
> according to diksa parampara. It is a line according to siksa parampara,
> bhagavat parampara. But these people do not understand that. They just say
> that Iskcon doesn't have bona fide disciplic succession. Once I was having
> an encounter with such person and I just asked him, "Did Caitanya Mahaprabhu
> predict that the Krishna consciousness movement will spread all over the
> world in every town and village?" They can't deny that. He said, "Yes.
> Mahaprabhu said that." Then I said that, "That prediction which is
> practically impossible, the one who fulfils that prediction of Sri Caitanya
> Mahaprabhu spread Krishna consciousness all over the world is he in the line
> of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu or not?" [Laughter. Applause.] You all are
> rejoicing but he became quiet. [Laughter]
> 
> So that is the most wonderful gift of Srila Prabhupada. He gave the highest
> spiritual wealth and organised it in such a way that it will continue to
> expand and eventually spread all over the world in every town and village.
> And we can see Prabhupada's expertise. Prabhupada's expertise was in forming
> this concept of collective management through the GBC. Prabhupada actually
> inherited that concept from his spiritual master, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta
> Sarasvati Thakura. It was his consideration to manage the society
> collectively through the governing body. Unfortunately his followers failed
> to do that and as a result of that his institution, Gaudiya Math
> disintegrated.
> 
> Prabhupada told us emphatically, "Don't make the same mistake that my god
> brothers made after Guru Maharaj's disappearance. Guru Maharaj told them to
> come and manage the society through a governing body. They did not. They
> rather appointed an acarya. When the acarya fell down, the whole structure
> collapsed." Then he said, "Don't make the same mistake." And we can see
> about thirty-five years after Srila Prabhupada's disappearance Iskcon is not
> only there but Iskcon is growing, Iskcon is expanding, Iskcon is becoming
> more and more wonderfully established in this planet. Iskcon is growing. It
> is all because of that, because in Iskcon the devotees have held Srila
> Prabhupada in his position as THE founder acarya and the society is being
> collectively managed through a governing body concept - GBC concept.
> Difficulties have been there. Crises have been there but in spite of all
> those difficulties Iskcon is still going strong just because of following
> these two principles. In our society at least I can say with firm conviction
> that it is in good hands. [Applause. Haribol.] I have been seeing all the
> leaders of Iskcon from a very close proximity and I can see how sincere, how
> dedicated and how expert they are in fulfilling this mission that Srila
> Prabhupada gave them.
> 
> Once I was with Radhanath Maharaj in New Vrindavan. After lunch we were
> lying down facing each other and Radhanath Maharaj was telling me, "You know
> I never wanted to be a leader. I was just happy. Kirtananda Swami was the
> leader and I was just there practicing my Krishna consciousness with reading
> and chanting, preaching. But now by some arrangement I have become a leader
> although I never wanted to become a leader." I told Maharaj, "That is the
> kind of leaders we need in Iskcon today." [Applause] One who doesn't want to
> become a leader but who leads by his own example that is a real leader. I
> feel very happy to see how Radhanath Maharaj is being appreciated and
> recognised all over the world. The places where he didn't even go I get to
> hear that they are just waiting for Radhanath Maharaj to come. [Applause]
> 
> I must also admit another wonderful leader of Iskcon is Gopal Bhatta Prabhu
> who does not have any position, doesn't have any title but he has gone out
> of his way to create a better Iskcon. He is a successful business man who
> didn't really have anything to do with Iskcon for many years but he noticed
> that Iskcon needs help so he came forward and started to give the help. And
> he did it in such a wonderful way. We needed a leader like him who is not a
> leader but is leading the movement, leading the leaders. I was mentioning
> that yesterday that generally the leader leads from the front. Gopal Bhatta
> Prabhu is leading from the back. He is pushing everyone, reminding everyone
> what they need to do.
> 
> In this way we have so many wonderful leaders in our movement. It is
> unfortunate that HH Jaypataka Mharaj became so sick now but still he is
> carrying on preaching. His spirit did not diminish. He is carrying on in
> spite of his physical difficulties he is pushing on the movement. That is a
> remarkable example. [Applause]
> 
> Another leader I will say is Gopal Krishna Maharaj. What a wonderful
> example. In his own way he is just following Srila Prabhupada's
> instructions. That is his mission. He simply, wholeheartedly, loyally
> follows Srila Prabhupada. Prabhupada wanted us to distribute books. He is
> just carrying on and look at the result. Not only are books going out in his
> zone but temples are coming up. In the city of Dehli there are six or seven
> temples now. [Applause] I made some miscalculation. Ten temples have come up
> in one city of Dehli.
> 
> So these are the devotees who are pushing on this movement so loyally.
> Bhakti Caitanya Maharaja is leading so wonderfully in South Africa, Russia
> and many other places. Romapada Maharaj, Bhakti Vaibhava Maharaj, Bhakti
> Vijnana Maharaj. Badri Narayan Prabhu's such a brilliant leader - so expert,
> so intelligent Svasa Prabhu in Los Angeles, such a wonderful leader.
> 
> We also have new leaders coming up. At least in Iskcon India I can see so
> many brilliant personalities are coming up like Bhakti Rasamrta Maharaj,
> Radhe Syam Prabhu, Bhaktivinode Maharaj, Gaura Narayan Maharaj. I am
> confident that Iskcon is going to carry on without any difficulty for years
> to come [Applause] because the movement is in good hands, in expert hands.
> Mind you - Prabhupada created Iskcon to create leaders. So all of you have
> the responsibility to become leaders, lead the world and show the way back
> to Goloka Vrindavan. Thank you very much. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.
> [Applause] it is already nine o'clock and the session will start at ten
> o'clock sharp so I won't invite any question today. Thank you all very much.
> All glories to Srila Prabhupada. Gaura-premanande Hari-haribol. [End]
