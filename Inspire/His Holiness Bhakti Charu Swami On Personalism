Question : "Can you please throw some light on the signifcance of relationships with the devotees and how important it is to have proper relationships amongst the devotees? 

His Holiness Bhakti Charu Swami: Srila Prabhupada used to say that ISKCON is the only personal movement when the whole world is becoming impersonalistic. ISKCON is actually allowing people, reminding people and facilitating people to develop personal relationships. So it is very painful that instead of being aware of the fact that we have to become personal, our extremely busy schedules do not enable us to become personal. That relationship is lacking. Those who are representing Krishna, they must remind everybody, through their behaviour that how personal Krishna is. This world is unpredictable and now we are getting old and this ability to travel may nolt be there, how do we maintain relationships? The best and most effective way is to become Krishna conscious. We are all part and parcel of Krishna and when we develop our relationship with Krishna then this relationship with Krishna in the center will continue. How it will continue we don't know but the best possible way is probably that we will be there with Krishna in the spiritual sky. That is how I used to console myself after Srila Prabhupada left. I used to think that some day, if I can go back to the spiritual sky then there I can find Srila Prabhupada and in a way that is the impetus for become more fixed up in spiritual life. Our love for Srila Prabhupada is kind of forcing us to become seriious in our spiritual lives and feel Srila Prabhupada or rather associate with Srila Prabhupada. That's why we have to go back to the spiritual sky and that's why you have to get out of this material world.
