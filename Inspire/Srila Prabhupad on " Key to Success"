Srila Prabhupada on "Key to Success"

You are right to just depend on Krsna. When He sees that you are sincere He will reveal everything to you. And this preaching work is your key to success in Krsna Consciousness

My dear Satadhanya,
Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated January 29 and I have noted the contents. Thank you very much for your sincere endeavor and faith in your Spiritual Master. The key to success in spiritual life is to always endeavor to please the Spiritual Master, and follow his instructions. One who is determined in this effort will advance very quickly in Krishna consciousness.
So far personal association with the Guru is concerned, I was only with my Guru Maharaja four or five times, but I have never left his association, not even for a moment. Because I am following his instructions, I have never felt any separation. There are some of my Godbrothers here in India who had constant personal association with Guru Maharaja, but who are neglecting his orders. This is just like the bug who is sitting on the lap of the king. He may be very puffed-up by his position, but all he can succeed in doing is biting the king. Personal association is not so important as association through service.
