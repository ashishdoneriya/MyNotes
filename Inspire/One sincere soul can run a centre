Hare Krishna 
Dandavat Pranama

Thank you for wonderful mail

I found this purport of Srila Prabhupada which is related to above theme so I am posting here. 

one who comes to this society, by associating a few days, a few weeks, he becomes conscious and he comes forward for initiation and further advancement. So this association is very important. And the, those who are conducting different centers and temples, they should be very responsible men. Because everything will depend on their sincere activities and character. If they are insincere, then that will not be effective. One may come and associate with us, but if we are insincere, then it will be not be effective. But if the devotees are sincere, anyone who will come in contact with a devotee, he'll change. That is the secret.

Srila Prabhupada in Purport of Gora Pahu song.
