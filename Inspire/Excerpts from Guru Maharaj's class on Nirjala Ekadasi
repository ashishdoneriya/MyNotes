Excerpts from Guru Maharaj's class on Nirjala Ekadasi from Lokarno, Switzerland on 20th June 2013.

ThThere are 26 Ekadasis

· 24 in 12 months +2 (Purusottam mas)

· 14th Ekadasi takes place in the month of Jyestha (Summer)

· This is hot season.

· Nirjala: Ekadasi which is meant to be fasted without even drinking water.

· In ISKCON Prabhupada did not set such lofty standard, since he had to deal with many westerners as well.

· Every Ekadasi is meant to be fasted without drinking water.

· Bhima had difficulty observing Ekadasi.

· Another name of Bhima is Vrkodara, he is very famous for his appetite.

· When Pandavas were in disguise, hiding in Ekacakra, half of the food collected was taken by Bhima.

· Vyasdeva gave this concession to Bhima. By fasting on Nirjala Ekadasi properly, you will get the benefit of fasting in all Ekadasis in the year.

· Even one should acamana very carefully.

· Caranamrta also should be taken very carefully.

· One should not try to take advantage of these things--taking more than required.

· Brahma muhurta to Brahma muhurta--full benefit

· Fasting full Day-- half benefit

· We should be very careful. Ekadasi is an arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead to free us from the sinful reactions.

· We should take full advantage of this day.

· Nirjala means without water.

· Ekadasi means eleventh. Eleventh day of the movement of the moon.

· Vedic calculation is based on the movement of the moon, while western one is based on the sun.

· A month consists of 30 days, 15 days-waxing period of the moon, and 15 days-waning period of the moon.

· Brahma-vaivarta Purana: Along with creation also came sins (people started to behave in the wrong way)

· All the sins personified in the form of Papa Purusa, responsible for giving miseries through sinful activities.

Causes of body parts of Papa Purusa:

· Killing a brahmana--> Head

· Taking intoxication--> Eyes

· Stealing gold--> Mouth

· Sexual intercourse with wife of the Guru--> nose

· Krishna also created Yamraj, meant to judge the living entities according to his sinful activities.

· Subtle body is the embodiment of the sinful activities.

· The living entity does not want to lose the body, so yamadutas whip and drag the subtle body out of the gross body.

· Devotees do not need to worry about that, since they have taken shelter of Krishna.

· Yamraj asks yamadutas not to trouble them.

· Even if devotees go to Yamaraj they are happy to greet him as a mahajan.

· Yamaraj's clerk is Citragupta, who keeps a record of all the sinful activities.

· So we should be very careful, our activities are getting recorded.

· Once Krishna visited Yamaraj, who was very pleased to greet Krishna and washed His feet.

· At that time Krishna heard the terrible cries of humans from the southern side.

· Yamaraj told Him that the sinful living entities were getting punished.

· Krishna went to see how the living entities were getting tortured due to their sinful activities.

· Krishna decided, I must do something to alleviate their suffering.

· He created a personality, a beautiful young woman--Ekadasi. She is Krishna's internal potency.

· Krishna arranged that if anyone fasts on this day, he will be free from all his sinful reactions.

· BG: sarva dharman parityajya

· Similarly Ekadasi is another such arrangement of Krishna to free the living entities of all their sinful reactions.

· Dharma-sastra: Just observe Ekadasi and be free from all sinful reactions.

· Because there were no sins the Papa purusa was dying.

· So when Visnu saw this, He asked him why you are in this condition.

· Sin: You are creator, so it is Your responsibility to maintain me. Because of Ekadasi, there are no more sins.

· Krishna: From now on all the sins on the Ekadasi day will enter into the food-grains.

· When the crops become ripe the plant dies and grains come.

· eg. wheat, rice, maize, pulses, beans

· They fall in the category of grains

· For the sake of Papa purusa Krishna made this arrangement that all the sins will enter into grains.

· Even if a person has not committed sins, still he gets them.

· So that is why we so strictly observe not taking grains.

· Devotees should be very careful not to take grains on this day.

· Ekadasi is also known as Hari-vasara--day of Hari since it is so dear to Hari.

· Hari: Supreme Personality of Godhead, vasara: day

· One who observes Ekadasi immensely pleases Krishna.

· There was a demon called Mura. He was so powerful that he defeated all the demigods and assumed the control of the universe.

· Being completely disturbed the demigods approached Lord Siva and asked him to help them.

· Lord Siva: You can go to the SUPREME PERSONALITY OF GODHEAD--Jagannath (Lord of the Universe)

· They went to Jagannath. He became very very angry, who dares to interfere in My arrangement.

· Mura was extremely powerful and was also supported by millions of other asuras.

· He counterattacked the demigods, who were unable to confront them.

· The demons then attacked the only person standing there--Hari.

· He released one weapon that killed many demons.

· Mura decided to confront Him.

· The leader themselves go forward.

· When Lord's weapons were no longer effective, he started to fight with bare hands.

· The Lord retreated to Badrikasram and went to a cave called Himavati (completely covered by ice)

· Chasing Him Mura also entered the cave and found the Lord sleeping. He decided to attack and kill Him.

· When he was about to attack, a beautiful woman appeared and stopped him.

· A battle ensued between them. Mura's weapons were ineffective.

· He started to fight with bare hands.

· Vedic tradition: When enemy loses weapons, one also throws his weapons.

· With her sharp weapon she cut the head of Mura and killed him.

· When the Lord woke up He asked, who are you?

· She narrated the whole story.

· Lord: Even I could not kill Mura, you have protected Me. You ask for any boon.

· Beautiful woman: From now on, whoever observes the austerities on this day, please free him of all sinful reactions.

· Utpanna Ekadasi: She appeared on this day.

· utpanna means generated

· It is good for health also. Our system gets complete rest. We have a tendency to overeat.

· The fire of digestion burns the undigested food and then starts burning the toxins also.

Our purpose should be to fast for spiritual benefit.
