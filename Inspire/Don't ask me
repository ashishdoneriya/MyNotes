Got this forwarded msg very useful for devotional practice.....
*Don't ask me:*
🔺Don't ask me how many years I have been practicing Krishna consciousness, it's better to ask *if I am free from lust  and anger.* 
🔺Don't ask me how many initiations I got, it's better to ask *if I cry while chanting Hari Naam.* 
🔺Don't ask me how many followers I have, it's better to ask *if my spiritual master is pleased with me.* 
🔺Don't ask me how many slokas I know by heart, it's better to ask *how many of them I have realized.* 
🔺Don't ask me how many books I have read, it's better to ask *how I behave with others.* 
🔺Don't ask me how many holy places I have visited, it's better to ask *how many pure devotees I have served.* 
🔺Don't ask me how many people I brought to Krsna consciousness, *it's better to ask how many people I have offended.* 
🔺Don't ask me how many festivals I have attended, it's better to ask *if my roommates were happy with me.* 
▶If you ask me these questions, then maybe I will burn because of shame and disgrace. Maybe *then I will stop accepting external achievements as the highest goal.* And maybe then finally I will start to improve myself *and become honest and sincere devotee...*
🙏🏼Hare Krishna🙏🏼
