For the time being you go on following the rules and regulations. It is being done by force. Where is the quality? So you wanted to understand quality. This is the quality. You'll not be forced, but automatically you'll desire. That is quality. I am writing books. I am not being forced by anyone. Everyone can do that. Why one does not do it? Why I get up at night, one o'clock, and do this job? Because I cannot do without it. How one will do it artificially? This is quality. Therefore they like my purports.

I have protested this false God consciousness in all my purports. That is my business, to punish all these rascals.

A realized soul, must be. Otherwise, simply by imitating A-B-C-D will not help. My purports are liked by people because it is presented as practical experience. (aside:) It is within the mouth.

If death takes place, let it take here. So there is nothing to be said new. Whatever I have to speak, I have spoken in my books. Now you try to understand it and continue your endeavor. Whether I am present or not present, it doesn't matter. As Kåñëa is living eternally, similarly, living being also lives eternally. But kértir yasya sa jévati: "One who has done service to the Lord lives forever." So you have been taught to serve Kåñëa, and with Kåñëa we'll live eternally. Our life is eternal. Na hanyate hanyamäne çarére [Bg. 2.20]. A temporary disappearance of this body, it doesn't matter. Body is meant for disappearance. Tathä dehäntara-präptiù [Bg. 2.13]. So live forever by serving Kåñëa.

Many many life times you are trying to enjoy and you can see that you are still not satisfied. Just offer this life to Krishna and see what happens even if at the end of this life nothing happens, what is the loss?  It is just one life time out of so many.
