Complete your 16 rounds"

It was the first time I had ever missed chanting 16 rounds... I had completed 14 and was so tired I rationalised that it was better to take rest and make them up the next day, as we had been told we could do... 

When I went into Srila Prabhupad's room early the next morning, the first thing His Divine Grace said to me was... “So, are you chanting all your rounds?”... as always, he knew everything without requiring any outside information... 

I told Him about missing two rounds the previous day, and that I was going to make them up that day... 

Srila Prabhupad said... 

“When you are regularly chanting 16 rounds, it is like a young child learning to walk with the help of the mother... because the mother is holding the child's hand, when the child starts to fall, the mother holds them up and they don’t actually fall... it is the same with chanting... 

If you are completing 16 rounds and start to fall down, Krishna will hold you up and not allow that to happen”... 

Then with His eyes open very wide and a transcendental move of His hand back and forth in front of His face, His Divine Grace said... 

“However, if you are not chanting at least 16 rounds every day, your whereabouts are unknown, and you will definitely fall down!”
