Is Spirituality for me?  My life is too fast  for it
 
Once when a plane was in flight, the co-pilot made an announcement, "I have good news and bad news. The good news is that we are going very fast and the bad news is that we don't know where we are going!"



For most people, life is like a 100 meter (or rather 100 year) sprint. No time for thinking. 

But it?s a strange sprint. Everyone - the gold medallist, the silver medallist,.. the last runner - gets the same prize - death.



If someone still insists that he just wants to come first in such a sprint and that he doesn't care for anything else, what can be said? 



"Where ignorance is bliss, it is foolish to be wise."
