During this period of increasing book distribution, one of Çréla Prabhupäda's newly initiated sannyäsés concocted the idea that the devotees should spend much more time studying. While visiting the New York temple, this sannyäsé openly advocated that devotees read Çréla Prabhupäda's books five to eight hours daily. The temple was following a new schedule Çréla Prabhupäda had set up, with devotees attending the morning program, going out all day for street chanting and book distribution, and returning in the evening for a class on Bhagavad-gétä. But now controversy arose, and an urgent phone call was placed to Çréla Prabhupäda in Los Angeles. When Prabhupäda heard the details from his secretary, he immediately responded.

My reply is that this sankirtan or street chanting must go on; it is our most important program. Lord Chaitanya's movement means the sankirtan move ment. You may simply take two hours for chanting sixteen rounds daily, two hours for reading congregationally, and balance of time go out for sankirtan. We must do both, reading books and distributing books, but distributing books is the main propaganda. Reading in class for two hours is sufficient, and other reading can be done in spare time if one has got it. It is not that one has to be always reading. One hour a morning for Bhägavata class and one hour evening, either Bhagavad-gétä or Nectar of Devotion, that is sufficient.

So i can see that there is very good potency at the present moment for spreading this movemetn as was desired by my Guru Maharaja, and I am simple trying my best to carry out this attitude, without any other motivation, surely Krishna will fulfill our desire. So push on with book publication and distribution, and I am very glad that you are now distributing to schools and libaries.
