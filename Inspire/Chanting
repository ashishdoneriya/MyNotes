Following are things that happens gradually when we don't chant properly. 

1) We have to struggle harder to do the same work we have been doing before. 

2) Things take longer to accomplish since the level of our concentration becomes weaker.

3) our level of tolerance goes down, we become irritable, angry and  impatient. 

4) We begin to find faults with others. 

5) We will start seeing spiritual master as an ordinary man, deity as stone and holy dham as ordinary land. - HH Jayapataka Swami Maharaj
