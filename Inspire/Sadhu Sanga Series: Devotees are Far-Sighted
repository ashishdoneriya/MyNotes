Dear Devotees,

Hare Krishna.
Please accept my humble obeisances.
All glories to Srila Guru Maharaja.
All glories to Srila Prabhupada.
 
For your pleasure, below is an excerpt from His Holiness Bhakti Charu Swami Maharaja’s lecture given on Srimad Bhagavatam 03.01.15, 26th March 2008, ISKCON Ujjain, India.

Devotees are Far-sighted

Once I was in Montreal, in the Olympic village. The authorities constructed the village for the Olympic Games that were held in Montreal in 1976. I think I was there in 1982 or possibly 1980. We used to go for a japa walk in the Olympic village because it was not far from the temple. One devotee picked flowers from the garden. You know how it is in the west. Nobody touches anybody else’s property. It is a disgrace you know. I told him that it is not good to take the flowers without permission and his response was, “Well, I am doing it for Krishna so it is alright.” Then one day, as he was picking flowers, the guard saw him and it brought so much disgrace to our society, because it became known that Hare Krishnas are stealing flowers. We should have a little foresight to see what will be beneficial for our movement and what will be harmful for our movement. We should not do anything that will be harmful to the movement or harmful to our own spiritual advancement. Just because we are devotees it does not give us the license to do anything we like. We have to maintain the standard of morality because that is what everyone follows.

Your aspiring servant
