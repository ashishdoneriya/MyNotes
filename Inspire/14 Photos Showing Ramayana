​​14  Pictures That Tell Us Ramayana Might Have Actually Happened
Give it a few minutes in case the photos show up  slowly

There is a great deal of  debate about whether there is any historical
accuracy in the story of Ramayana. For many of us, this  is a no-brainer.
The fact that our elders had told us the heroic story of Lord  Ram's victory
over Raavan was enough. And then there's the
if-there's-a-TV-show-about-it-it-must've-happened crowd.
But that's not how  history works.
There are many things  about the Ramayana that are absolutely mythological.
A  demon king with ten heads? Yeah, right. Talking monkeys? Nope. Didn't
exist.  Demon uncle that could morph into a deer? Don't think so. A flying
chariot? No  way. Demi-god who could take the form of a vulture? Again, no.
But

here's the  thing - Ramayana wasn't originally written as a historical text
but as an  epic poem. Whether we like it or not, creative liberty was a
thing back  then too.

But if we remove all the myth from the story, it is  basically about an
exiled prince waging war against a king from another kingdom  who kidnapped
his

wife. And that could have happened. We cannot prove or  disprove anything.
But at least we can present a list of places that are  mentioned in the
Ramayana.
The place in Ayodhya where Hanuman was patiently waiting while Ram was in
exile, is now a temple called Hanuman Garhi.

There's an actual Janki Temple in Janakpur in Nepal. Janki, as we know, is
another name for Sita, Janaka's daughter.

When Ram, Sita and Lakshman went into exile, they set up a hut in
Panchavati, which is an actual area near Nashik. Tapovan, a nearby spot, is
where Lakshman encountered Surpanakha.

Sita was abducted by Raavan, they bumped into Jatayu, a demi-god in vulture
form, who tried his best to stop Raavan. Lepakshi, in Andhra Pradesh, is
said to be the place where Jatayu fell.

Ram, accompanied by Hanuman, met the dying Jatayu. Ram helped him  attain
moksha by uttering the words "Le  Pakshi", which is Telugu for "Rise, bird".
Hence the name,  Lepakshi. There's also a large footprint in that area which
is said to be that  of Hanuman's.

Sethu, the bridge made of stones built by Ram's army that  connected the
mainland to the island kingdom of Lanka, actually exists, albeit  now, it's
underwater.

Meanwhile, in Lanka, Raavan's devotion to Lord Shiva earned him the respect
of the God. So much so that he built his devotee a temple. This is the only
time  when a temple is dedicated to the one who prayed and not the one being
prayed  to. Today, it exists as Koneswaram Temple in Sri Lanka.

Here's the part of the temple where Raavan has been idolized. While having
10 heads is an exaggeration, the idea is based on the fact that Raavan ruled
10  kingdoms which meant that he had 10 different crowns.

It is said that the Kanniya hot wells near the temple were also built by
Raavan. They still exist.

When Raavan brought Sita to Lanka, he first took her to this place called
Sita Kotuwa, which is now a tourist spot in Sri Lanka.

here, he took her to the beautiful forest, which in Valmiki's text was
called Ashok Vatika. There is an  actual Ashokavanamin Sri Lanka.

Hanuman reached Ashok Vatika, he is said to have come in  the form of a
giant. There are giant imprints on one side of the lake there  which are
said to be Hanuman's footprints, formed when he landed.

they say "Hanuman set Lanka on fire" what they actually mean is he set fire
to certain parts of Raavan's palace. The ground here is said to be somewhat
black which is nothing like the surrounding area. The picture below is from
Ussangoda, which according to mythology was the landing strip for Raavan's
Pushpak Vimaan.

After Ram rescued Sita from Lanka, he made her go through Agni  Pariksha to
test her purity.  The place where this is said to have happened is
Divurumpola in Sri Lanka. There  is a tree in that exact spot and even
today, local disputes are settled through  debates and discussions under
that tree.

fact that these  places actually exist is perhaps not enough to prove
Ramayana actually happened. But then again, we  need to understand that this
epic was not written as one definite piece of  text. Valmiki collected data
from different sources  and combined them with his own knowledge of events,
(curated content FTW!) which  was largely passed down orally through the
years. And then other writers too  contributed to it by adding details. The
thing is, it is a little pointless to  argue about the historical accuracy
of the Ramayana. Whether it  happened or not, is not as important as the
message of good triumphing over evil  it has spread throughout the passage
of time.
