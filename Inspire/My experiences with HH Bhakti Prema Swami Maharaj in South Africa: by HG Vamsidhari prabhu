Dear devotees,

Please accept my humble obeisances. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.Allglories to Sri Guru & Gauranga.

Since the time I came back from South Africa, many devotees had suggested me to write about my experiences with HH Bhakti Prema Swami Maharaj in South Africa.
Following are the things which I observed & learnt during my association with HH Bhakti Prema Swami Maharaj during his South Africa visit. Although Maharaj exhibits wonderful Vaishnava qualities at every moment, it needs maturity to observe and appreciate these qualities. I have surely missed many many points about him. This is due to my immaturity and lack of spiritual vision. I am able to write this letter based on whatever little I could observe and learnt by being in Maharaj’s most divine association. I am writing this letter just to purify my heart by glorifying one of the dear most devotees of the Lord. Please forgive my mistakes while writing this and bless me that I may apply the things which I learnt during his association.
1.       Sensitivity: Maharaj does not give any specific choice. He is satisfied with anything he gets and able to appreciate it.

Ex: Maharaj came to Mumbai at 01:55 pm flight from Kolkata. Devotees kept Mahaprasad and some other things for him to take prasada but wanted his choice so that they can prepare the things accordingly so while going to Juhu temple, when one devotee asked maharaj about his choice in prasadam, maharaj told that he does not have any specific choice. Although he took little breakfast in the morning, he told that no need to cook for me especially. I will take prasadam when it will be made for all the devotees in brahmachari ashram. He does not want to give even a slight of discomfort to someone. He did not give his preferences so that some other devotee should not take out time for preparing somethings specially for Maharaj. He is ready to sacrifice his need for the sake of giving comfort to devotees.

He is always very careful about content of prasadam. He does not take packed juices, Soya products and also he avoids taking prasadam from Govinda restaurants since it’s not sure who prepared it.

Normally he keeps ekadasi fasting very strict but once when he was staying in one devotee’s home on Ekadashi, he agreed to take prasadam as per the choice of devotee so that prabhuji will feel happy and satisfied by serving Maharaj.

2.       Avyartha kalatvam:

Venue: Mumbai Airport 30.07.15, 01:30-03 am. While doing the formality of custom clearance and other things, I was feeling so much sleep due to whole night wake up. Whenever I saw maharaj, he was chanting constantly. When we sat on waiting lounge in front of boarding gate, I was totally exhausted but he was still chanting constantly on his beads with no signs of sleepiness. Whenever I saw him in his room also during the whole tour, he was chanting reading or hearing. He is always absorbed in hearing the divine sound vibration. In this way he is totally absorbed in Krishna consciousness.

   

3.       Attentive to the surrounding and helping nature:

Venue: Abu Dhabi airport waiting lounge:

30.07.15, 07:30 am: Maharaj helping 2 chinese mataji by giving his water bottle. Normally at the airport its difficult to drink water if we don’t have our own bottles. Those 2 matajis were trying but not able to drink water. We were sitting close by. Maharaj saw them while taking breakfast and gave his own water bottle to them permanently. They were very much obliged by this help and then Maharaj kindly talked with them for 1-2 minutes.  I am sure by this small conversation of those 2 matajis with Maharaj, their spiritual credits must have started by getting the association of a pure devotee of the Lord. They may very soon be involved in Krishna consciousness fully.

4. He can connect everything and every incidence with Krishna: One devotee named “Annira” came to pick us up from Durban Airport and take us to temple on 31.07.15. When Maharaj asked his name and he told that his name is “Annira”. For some time Maharaj was thinking about his name then he told that you got a very good name which means “one who has no material shelter means pure devotee”. I was amazed to see maharaj’s deep knowledge of scriptures and his expertise to connect everything and every incidence with Krishna. It was actually typical south African name and even that prabhuji did not know the meaning of this so he thanked a lot to maharaj for this.
5.   Giving spontaneous lecture: Maharaj gave almost lectures spontaneously. In most of the cases he was asking the topic only after sitting on vyasasan. All lectures came out perfectly composed. He told once to me that when he prepares for the lectures, it becomes artificial and theoretical. In his lectures, he uses many examples to teach us some point. Examples were coming so spontaneous from his lotus mouth.
Almost all of the examples which he gave were spontaneous and extra ordinary. Once while giving lecture on Sri Krishna Janmasthmi he gave one very nice analogy which I liked very much:
“ In the cricket tournament, when we come to know that India and Pakistan are going to play, then we go well before and try to take the best place available in the audience area. Similarly when Krishna comes, all the planets take the best places in sky just to observe Krishna’s most auspicious arrival in this world”
For the temple brahmacharis he gave classes on various topics like meaning of different Aratis and topics from Srimad Bhagavatam. He was so affectionately and diligently teaching them the principles of Krishna consciousness through these simple but very deep classes. Maharaj was teaching them  affectionately and patiently although they knew very less or no hindi or Sanskrit. It reminded me of Srila Prabhupada teaching to his western disciples about the Sanskrit Vaishnava literatures and etiquettes.
Whenever he was meeting with new students, he was trying to inspire them for increasing their number of rounds. He was appreciating those devotees a lot who are sincere in their sadhana especially whole Morning program.
6. Very Humble: in his humility, he always thinks himself servant of the servant. Many times he mentioned me that only because of Guru Maharaj’s instructions and mercy, he has taken up this responsibility. He wants to serve the instruction of superiors by accepting the sannyas ashram and travelling and preaching.
7. All the devotees love him so much in all places in south africa. Some devotee cried tears of separation when he left from their home. He met one prabhuji in Johanesburg for the first time only for half a day and next day we were leaving south Africa. Within half day, that devotee was so much in love with maharaj that he was crying uncontrollably when maharaj left for airport. He told to devotees that he sees his spiritual master in the personality of Maharaj.
8. Maharaj does not have his personal priorities. He preaches only according to the wish of local temple authorities. He told that as a sannyasi, he should be detached while preaching and he is there only to fulfill the desires of local authorities.
All of the godbrothers were treating him as a representative of Guru Maharaj and offering him services like Guru Maharaj. Maharaj never accepted the bed which was used by Guru Maharaj. Even many devotees tried to convince him with many logics but he did not accept. He was sleeping at floor using sleeping mattress at all devotees’ house.
 
Diary entries:
01.08.15: Insisting on serving prasadam to other devotee who is sitting with him first and then accepting prasadam.

31.07.15: Maharaj immediately came down from vyasasan when HH Bhakti Gaurvani Maharaj came to temple hall. It was the schedule of HH BPSM giving lecture and he already started the lectures but immediately after the sudden arrival of  HH Bhakti Gaurvani Swami Maharaj, he came down from Vyasasan and sat as an audience to honour maharaj. He told that he wants to hear from others. Hearing from the realizations of other devotees, is the thing which he likes the most.

26.08.15: All brahmacharis at Durban liked him so much. While bidding him farewell from Durban all devotees were standing on both side of the car. His dealings with all devotees were so affectionate especially with new brahmacharis, he was very friendly to encourage them to continue nicely.
Very strict in morning program: It was very intense spiritual experience to be  in the association of maharaj for the whole morning program every day. Chanting sessions were very intense due to his presence. Also his very sincere mood of praying to the Lord was reflected on all and everyone was feeling that this intense spiritual vibration, they have not felt from a long time.

15.08.15: I gave one Srimad Bhagavatam class in Durban temple. When I asked maharaj about my class, he replied that Krishna katha is already pure and always palatable and we should not add other things, jokes just for making other feels entertained. We should not mix papad, chutney like things in it to make it more palatable. Meaning is that we should purely speak Krishna conscious philosophy while sitting on Vyasasan and not to add the things just for entertainment.

Maharaj has a very good hope for local African black peoples. He told that blacks were being dominated and ignored by European white people for many many years at South Africa during apartheid. If we just give them love, affection and care they can very easily take up process of Krishna consciousness.
 
·         He does not want to accept services. Its difficult to serve him because he is satisfied and has no need. Even if we make mistakes, he does not make us come to know that because of our mistake, he felt inconvenience.

·         He does not want to take any extra facility for himself. He feels very bad when we offer him facilities more than others.

·         We can appreciate Guru Maharaj even more when we are with HH Bhakti Prema Swami Maharaj. He can completely understood the heart of Guru Maharaj and his all dealings, decisions are based on this understanding to please Guru Maharaja.

·         Hemanga Chaitanya Prabhu mentioned to me that whatever he knows about Guru Maharaj, he came to know from HH Bhakti Prema Swami Maharaj only.

·         Serving him is very blissful because we are able to hear his purifying voice all the time. Even when he was in his room with me, he was continuously talking about Lord Krishna, Lord Chaitanya, Srila Prabhupada, Guru Maharaj and devotees. All the time he is preaching by his lectures, talks and by his most exemplary behavior. Also he was so much concerned about my prasadam timings, health and other things.

·         He always remains back while accepting the privileges. He tries to put other devotees ahead of him and likes to be at back. This extreme humble nature of Maharaj attracted so many devotees at Durban and Johanesburg.

·         Guru Maharaj told him to try to learn something from everyone while visiting South Africa, So he was always trying to learn things and skills from devotees there. He asked to our senior godbrother HG Tribhanga Sundar Prabhu about the mood he should have while receiving so much respect which comes to him as a sannyasi? Also he is very eager to hear from other devotees and making nice relationship with other devotees.

·         His dealings with devotee are so much attractive and based on loving and serving others. He knows likes of many devotees in Durban and always tries to serve them and please them accordingly.

·         He is always very tolerant. Many times due to my mistakes or forgetful nature, he had to face discomforts but he never chastised me for those mistakes. In all circumstances, he would say very lovingly what right thing could have been done at that time?

I came to know many of Maharaj’s likes and preferences by the mercy of HG Abhaya Charan prabhu who was serving Maharaj in his Europe trip earlier this year. I am eternally grateful to Prabhuji for guiding me about how to serve maharaj understanding his mood.

Thank you very much. Hare Krishna.
Your servant
Vamsidhari Das
