Manabodha-cautisa, Instructions to the Mind, a song by the Oriya vaisnava Bhakta Charan Das:

kaha-i mana are mo bola kara
kalasrimukha bare dekhiba calare

kete dinaku mana bandhuchu anta
ki ghenijibu tora chutile ghatare

khandi je khandi tora panjara kathi
khauna thibe svana srga√øa bantire

khat palanke mana sejai sou
khala durgandha heba e tora dehure

galeni to sangaru jeteka jana
ganthire banddhinele ke kete dhanare

guru gobinda nama tunde nabolu
gadhe majjina nitye dhana arjilure

gharaboli arjichu jete padartha
ghata chutile tote bolibe bhutareg

ghara gharani deha kilauthibe
gheni bandhu kutumba suddha hoibere

I say to you, O mind: Obey my order!
Let us go and see the beautiful black-faced one [Lord Jagannath]!

For how long will you remain bound in material life?
At the end of your life, what will you take with you?
Piece by piece your ribs will be distributed Amongst the dogs and jackals.
O mind, you are now sleeping comfortably on a nice mattress,
But after death your body will give off a terrible smell.
How many of your friends and family have already died?
How much of their wealth could they bind in a cloth to take with them?
You have never uttered the names of guru and Govinda!
Always deeply absorbed in thinking how to gather wealth,
You are acquiring so many things like house and family!
But when your life is gone, all will cry, "Ghost!"
The ladies of the house will close up the doors.
And only after the recommended period of purification will your relatives be considered freed from contamination.
