Book Distribution
​
​
Book distribution is the most important form of preaching, and it does not even depend on how long a devotee has been in our movement, it may be for a few days, a few years, or may be for even twenty years, all of them can do book distribution very well. Prabhupada always said book distribution is the most important form of preaching. He emphasized this at his darshans, in his letters and in his purports. So we must meditate on how we can distribute books, for the sake of bringing happiness to others. If you are determined to distribute books, then Krishna who resides in everyone's heart will make you His instrument in doing so.

 Book Distribution
​
Out of various programs that Srila Prabhupada gave us by which we can distribute mercy, the most important activity is book distribution. Why? These books contain the words of the Supreme Lord and the explanations by the pure devotees and the predecessor acaryas. When Srila Prabhupada wrote the purports of these verses, he used to refer to the commentaries of predecessor acaryas. In other words, these books contain the instructions of the Lord and when the devotees endeavor to give these books to others, they are actually engaging in the highest welfare activity. The highest welfare activity one can engage in this planet is to give people these transcendental books because they have the capacity to destroy the illusionary concept of life and to get one attached to the process of bhakti.

​This marathon is for everyone. We should not say that I don't want to participate in this. In fact, we should be very enthusiastic about participation in book distribution marathon. This marathon month is more auspicious and powerful than Kartik. Participation in book distribution is the easiest way to attract Krsna's mercy. If you take part in it, Krsna will be very pleased with you.
