Dear Devotees,

Hare Krishna.

Please accept my humble obeisances.

All glories to Srila Guru Maharaja.

All glories to Srila Prabhupada.

For your pleasure, below is an excerpt from His Holiness Bhakti Charu Swami Maharaja's lecture given on 25 July 2004, Prabhupadadesh.

This Body is Wonderful
Accept everything as Krishna’s mercy, even if you go through difficulties. Accept it as Krishna’s mercy that He is helping you to make spiritual progress. Isn’t this a wonderful world where you get the opportunity to serve Krishna? Isn’t it a wonderful body with which we can serve Krishna so nicely? Isn’t it because of this wonderful body that we are able to have wonderful association with the devotees? So, why should we ever destroy this opportunity?

Your servant
