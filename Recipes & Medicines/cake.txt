Basic cake recipe
Ingredients
2 cup maida
1 tspn baking powder
1/2 tspn baking soda
1 cup oil
1 cup sugar
1 cup milk 
1 tspn vanilla essence
Method
First sieve maida, baking powder and baking soda three times and keep aside. Combine the sugar,milk and oil in a bowl and whisk well till all the sugar dissolves then add the vanilla essence and whisk again. Now add the flour mixture and mix gently. Pour the batter into a greased and dusted tin. Bake in a pre-heated oven at 160°c for 35 minutes. Keep aside to cool and use as required. For icing we can use whipped cream ( butter icing and sugar paste available in market) easily. You can choose and decorate with different style. 
For butter icing take 20 gm butter and 80 gm icing sugar beat it well and then add little milk if the cream is thick. this icing will not melt (you can keep cake outside for two days). Now ready to offer it to Lord Krishna.
