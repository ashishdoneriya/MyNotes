Remove black line from (15.04 - Vivid) Files/Nautilus sidebar

Copying your theme to your home folder
Open a terminal:

mkdir ~/.themes/
cp -R /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/ ~/.themes/Ambiance

(if you are not using the Ambiance theme (default), you will need to adapt the last command)

Editing nautilus.css
In a terminal open nautilus.css:

gedit ~/.themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/apps/nautilus.css
Add the following lines to the end of the file:

NautilusWindow .sidebar .separator,
NautilusWindow .sidebar .view .separator {
   color: shade (@bg_color, 0.95); 
}
Save the file.

Log out and in again (or enter nautilus -q command in Terminal to restart Nautilus) and you are done.
