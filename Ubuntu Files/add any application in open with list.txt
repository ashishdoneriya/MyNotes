How to add any application in open with list:

this tutorial is demonstrated with Pinta image editor. You can use the similar steps for any program. Just change the Pinta with your application names in the commands we are going to use.

To add any program in the list of default list of open with applications, open a terminal and use the following command:
~/.local/share/applications/
sudo gedit /usr/share/applications/XXX.desktop
Please note two things. In XXX.desktop, XXX is the name of your application. And then use of gedit. You can use any other editor. I used Vim. If you use Gedit, it will dispaly some warning messages in the terminal but will open the file in a GUI.

In this desktop file, look for a line that looks like this:

Exec=XXX

If you have something like this, replace this line with:

Exec=XXX %F
