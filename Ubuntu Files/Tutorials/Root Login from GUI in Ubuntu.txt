Root Login from GUI in Ubuntu 12.04

Many of us already know that ubuntu in its every distro has root login disabled by default. Still some root-lovers find it convenient to login directly as root. Normally it is a good practice to not use root account directly. It can be hazardous in both intentional or unknowing ways. I usually prefer sudo and su commands for any such root access in ubuntu.

Still if you want to enable your root account then you will need to follow the below mentioned steps -
1. Open up your terminal

2. Execute the below command to enable the root login from GUI. (Considering the fact that your root account password is already set)
# sudo gedit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf

3.Here in this file we have to add one more line that goes as follows
greeter-show-manaul-login=true

3. Reboot the system for the changes to take effect and login as root by username as root and the corresponding root password.
